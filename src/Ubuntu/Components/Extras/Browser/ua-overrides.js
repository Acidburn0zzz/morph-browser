// B2G’s list of overrides: https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/build/ua-override-prefs.js

// List of user agent string overrides in the form of an object.
// Each key is a domain name for which the default user agent string doesn’t
// work well enough. Values can either be a string (full override) or an array
// containing two values that are passed to the String.replace method (the
// first value may be either a string or a regular expression, the second value
// must be a string).
// Examples of valid entries:
//     "example.org": "full override"
//     "example.com": ["Ubuntu", "Ubuntu Edge"]
//     "google.com": [/mobi/i, "b"]
var overrides = {
};
