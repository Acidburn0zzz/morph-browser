Unity.InputInfo:

The structure of the directories has been kept identical, to ease syncing the
code in the future. Minor changes were made to the build system to integrate it
with the existing webbrowser-app code base.

As of 2015-12-09, the SwipeArea component is available in the UITK, so we should
start using it instead of building a local copy of Ubuntu.Gestures. This is
currently blocked on https://launchpad.net/bugs/1459362.

The Unity.InputInfo plugin should be replaced by an upstream Qt API in the near
future.
