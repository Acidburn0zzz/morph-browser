Code in this directory was copied over from unity8.

Unity.InputInfo:
 - first import: 2016-01-28, at revision 2143 of lp:unity8

The structure of the directories has been kept identical, to ease syncing the
code in the future. Minor changes were made to the build system to integrate it
with the existing webbrowser-app code base.

The Unity.InputInfo plugin should be replaced by an upstream Qt API in the near
future.
