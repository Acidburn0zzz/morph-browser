webbrowser-app is a lightweight web browser tailored for Ubuntu,
based on the Webkit rendering engine and using the Ubuntu UI components.


= Building =

The build system uses cmake.
To compile, simply invoke cmake and then make:

    $ cmake .
    $ make


= Running =

webbrowser-app can be run from the development branch without the need to
install any files. Just run:

    $ ./src/app/webbrowser-app

The executable accepts command line switches and parameters. To find out which,
just run:

    $ ./src/app/webbrowser-app --help


= Unit tests =

To run the unit tests, you can use the commands below:

    $ make test

      - or -

    $ ctest


= Automated UI tests =

webbrowser-app uses autopilot (https://launchpad.net/autopilot) to test its UI.
To run the tests, you will need to install python-autopilot and libautopilot-qt.
Then do the following:

    $ cd tests/autopilot/
    $ autopilot run webbrowser_app

You can get a list of all available tests with the following command:

    $ autopilot list webbrowser_app


= Code coverage =

To generate a report with detailed code coverage, you need to re-run cmake with
"CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage":

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage .
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make coverage

This will generate a coverage report in XML format (coverage.xml) and an
interactive human-readable report in HTML format (coveragereport/index.html).
