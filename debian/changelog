  * Move unit tests to separate directories.
  * Separate the app and the plugin into two packages, and rename the
    plugin and move it under Ubuntu.Components.Extras.Browser.
  * Use standard toolbar buttons for the chrome.
  * Remove an unused variable assignment.
  * Increase a test’s timeout to ensure it passes even on really slow
    configurations (like my laptop these days).
  * Do not keep the new tab button always visible, per design request.
  * Instruct the input method to not use predictive text in the address
    bar.
  * Center the tabs view on the current tab when showing the activity
    view.
  * Disable the current webview while the activity view is visible, thus
    avoiding mouse events to go through.
  * 10 seconds was too much, as it’s also the timeout threshold for the
    Eventually matcher that verifies that the page has loaded. Lowering
    the page load time to 8 seconds should do the trick.
  * Update the tabs view header text to match the latest visual design.
  * Use colors from the standard color palette, where available.

  * Ensure that the chrome won’t be automatically hidden while testing
    interaction with the toolbar. This should fix flaky autopilot tests.
  * More reliable way of asserting that a page has finished loading.
    This should make tests more robust.
  * Always format the suggestions as rich text, to ensure ampersands are

  * Add translators comments for the keywords associated to HUD actions.
  * Enable multiple tabs in the browser. Only the basic functionality is
    in place, further iterations will refine the functionality and the
    visuals.
  * Make as many test cases as possible inherit from
    StartOpenRemotePageTestCaseBase. This should make them overall more
    robust by avoiding race conditions with the chrome automatically
    hiding when the homepage has finished loading.
  * Ensure the suggestions list is hidden when the panel is hidden. (LP:
