  * The application name is being set from the APP_ID during the init
    phase of the webbrowser app but it is later being overwritten
    because of the applicationName property in the browser MainView. One
    option could be to get rid of the applicationName property update
    altogether but it is being used by the MainView to update the domain
    for the i18n plugin which is itself flawed in a way since it does
    not fallback on the Qtcore::applicationName but requires the
    applicationName property of a MainView to be set explicitely. . (LP:
    #1229942)

  [ Olivier Tilloy ]
  * When the activity view cannot be found, return None instead of
    raising an exception, as that’s what tests expect.
  * Contextual menus with specific actions for links and images when

  * Fix dependencies alignment in debian/control.
  * Adjust margins in the chrome to be consistent with the default
    toolbar. (LP: #1223946)
  * New assets and visual tweaks for the expanded activity view. (LP:
    #1223952)
  * Updated translation template.
  * Go directly to the entry instead of expanding the timeline view when
    there is only one entry for a given domain. This change has been
    requested by design.
  * Very basic support for ini-style read-only settings. This is a
    temporary solution until Settings support lands in the SDK. At the
    moment, only the default homepage can be customized. To change the
    default homepage, one can write the following line to
    ~/.config/webbrowser-app/settings.conf:     homepage =
    http://example.org.
  * Match domains for overriding the UA string by starting from the full
    domain name, and iterating down to the TLD. This ensures that if
    there is an override rule for "b.a.c", it will get precedence over
    another existing rule for "a.c".

  * Add a command line argument for webapps that allows one to specify
    the root path for installed webapp searches. The uses cases are
    multiple, among other things local testing, and click packages
    (where webapps are installed in /opt/) and should be looked up
    there. For click webapps, the desktop-click hook will set the CWD
    when starting the app to the local click app folder and aa_exec will
    make sure that all is properly setup. Given the containment rules
    for click apps, the webbrowser-app should be told where to look for
    the webapp content (javascript snippet) and not follow the usual
    desktop rules (and the Exec line from the webapp desktop file should
    explicitly specify where to look for it based on CWD). .

  [ Kaleo ]
  * Remove unnecessary use of theming.

  [ Olivier Tilloy ]
  * Move unit tests to separate directories.
  * Separate the app and the plugin into two packages, and rename the
    plugin and move it under Ubuntu.Components.Extras.Browser.
  * Use standard toolbar buttons for the chrome.
  * Remove an unused variable assignment.
  * Increase a test’s timeout to ensure it passes even on really slow
    configurations (like my laptop these days).
  * Do not keep the new tab button always visible, per design request.
  * Instruct the input method to not use predictive text in the address
    bar.
  * Center the tabs view on the current tab when showing the activity
    view.
  * Disable the current webview while the activity view is visible, thus
    avoiding mouse events to go through.
  * 10 seconds was too much, as it’s also the timeout threshold for the
    Eventually matcher that verifies that the page has loaded. Lowering
    the page load time to 8 seconds should do the trick.
  * Update the tabs view header text to match the latest visual design.
  * Use colors from the standard color palette, where available.
  * Initial timeline view implementation.

  * Ensure that the chrome won’t be automatically hidden while testing
    interaction with the toolbar. This should fix flaky autopilot tests.
  * More reliable way of asserting that a page has finished loading.
    This should make tests more robust.
  * Always format the suggestions as rich text, to ensure ampersands are
    not incorrectly escaped. (LP: #1187432)
  * Add translators comments for the keywords associated to HUD actions.
  * Enable multiple tabs in the browser. Only the basic functionality is
    in place, further iterations will refine the functionality and the
    visuals.
  * Make as many test cases as possible inherit from
    StartOpenRemotePageTestCaseBase. This should make them overall more
    robust by avoiding race conditions with the chrome automatically
    hiding when the homepage has finished loading.
  * Ensure the suggestions list is hidden when the panel is hidden. (LP:

  * Remove the HUD Quit action as it is deprecated and will be removed
